* On average, trips to Newark result in the highest tip at $11. 
* Credit cards are the preferred mode of payment accounting for a significant 75% of all transactions, followed by cash.
* One-person trips make up the majority, comprising 66% of all recorded journeys.
* The bustling area around Jackson Ave, near the Queens Plaza station in Long Island City stands out as the top pickup location.
* The highest fare occurs at 2pm suggesting a peak period of travel. In contrast, the lowest fare is observed at 7am, likely due to off-peak hours.
